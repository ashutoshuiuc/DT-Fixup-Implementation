Implemented DT-Fixup technique first presented in "Optimizing Deeper Transformers on Small Datasets" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15355). We implemented
transformer architecture from scratch and implemented the architecture on custom models using same datasets as mentioned in the paper.
We compare vanilla transformers with DT-Fixup based model to verify the efficacy of the technique.
